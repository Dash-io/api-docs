title: 'Tracking a Delivery'
---

Once a delivery is assigned, your customers (and your operations team) will want to know where it is. This guide covers how to get the real-time status of a delivery.

The primary way to track a delivery is by polling the "Get Delivery" endpoint.

### Getting a Delivery's Status

To check the status, you'll make a `GET` request to `/deliveries/{id}`, using the **Delivery ID** from our previous guides.

```bash
curl --request GET \
     --url [https://dev.api.fleets.usedora.com/api/v1/deliveries/del_abc789xyz1](https://dev.api.fleets.usedora.com/api/v1/deliveries/del_abc789xyz1) \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

Reading the Status

The response object will contain the real-time status of the delivery.

If the rider just picked it up:

The rider updates the status (usually via their rider app). When you poll the endpoint, you'll see the status has changed to in-transit.

```
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "id": "del_abc789xyz1",
    "status": "in-transit", // <-- Updated!
    // ...
    "rider": { ... }
  }
}
```
If the delivery is complete:

Once the rider drops off the package and confirms it, the status will be updated to delivered.

```
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "id": "del_abc789xyz1",
    "status": "delivered", // <-- Final status!
    // ...
    "rider": { ... }
  }
}
```

Summary

You've now completed the entire flow:

    Created a detailed delivery.

    Assigned it to a rider.

    Tracked its status from "pending" to "delivered".

You now have all the core building blocks to integrate Dora into your application.
