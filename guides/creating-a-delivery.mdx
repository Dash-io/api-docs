title: 'Creating a Delivery'
---

In the [Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart), you created a basic delivery. This guide will cover the process in more detail, including all the common fields you'll need.

A **Delivery** is the central object in the Dora API. It represents a single order that needs to be picked up from one location and dropped off at another.

### The Delivery Lifecycle

A delivery moves through several statuses:

1.  **`pending`**: The delivery has been created but is not assigned to a rider.
2.  **`assigned`**: A rider has been assigned to the delivery.
3.  **`in-transit`**: The rider has picked up the package.
4.  **`delivered`**: The rider has dropped off the package and confirmed delivery.
5.  **`delivered`**: The rider has dropped off the package and confirmed delivery.
6.  **`cancelled`**: The delivery was cancelled.

### Creating a Detailed Delivery

To create a delivery, you send a `POST` request to the `/deliveries` endpoint. Here’s a more complete example with common fields.

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --url [https://dev.api.fleets.usedora.com/api/v1/deliveries](https://dev.api.fleets.usedora.com/api/v1/deliveries) \
     --header 'x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data '{
        "customer_name": "Jane Smith",
        "customer_phone": "+2348011112222",
        
        "pickup_address": "100 Adetokbo Ademola St, Victoria Island, Lagos",
        "pickup_instructions": "Ask for 'Dora Pickup' at the front desk.",
        
        "dropoff_address": "50B Fola Osibo Rd, Lekki Phase 1, Lagos",
        "dropoff_instructions": "Call customer on arrival. Leave at the gate if no answer.",
        
        "package_description": "1x box of documents",
        "payment_method": "card",
        "payment_status": "paid"
     }'
```

The Response

If successful, the API returns the full delivery object with a 201 status.

Save the id from this response. You'll need it for the next steps, like assigning a rider.

```
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "id": "del_abc789xyz1",
    "status": "pending",
    "customer_name": "Jane Smith",
    // ... all other fields
  }
}
```

Next Step

Now that you have a pending delivery, the next step is to get a rider to pick it up. Let's move on to Managing Riders.
