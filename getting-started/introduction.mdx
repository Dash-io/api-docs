## What is Dora?

Welcome to the Dora API documentation. Dora is a complete, developer-first platform for building and scaling last-mile delivery and logistics operations.

If you're building an on-demand delivery app, adding delivery services to your e-commerce store, or managing a fleet of riders, our API provides the tools to handle everything from pickup to proof-of-delivery.

### Key Features

Our platform is built around a simple, powerful REST API that lets you:

* **📦 Create & Manage Deliveries:** Programmatically create new delivery orders, update their status, and manage the entire lifecycle in real-time.
* **🛵 Assign & Track Riders:** Onboard your riders, assign them to deliveries, and track their real-time location and progress.
* **⚙️ Automate Your Operations:** Build complex logistics workflows, like automatic rider assignment, batching deliveries, and calculating ETAs.
* **🧾 Handle Proof of Delivery:** Upload signatures or photos at the drop-off location to confirm a delivery is complete.

### Who is this for?

The Dora API is designed for any business that needs to move goods from point A to point B.

* **On-Demand Services:** Food delivery, grocery apps, and local couriers.
* **E-commerce & Retail:** Local businesses and online stores adding a "local delivery" option.
* **Logistics Platforms:** Companies building their own fleet management or dispatch software.
