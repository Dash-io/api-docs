Let's get you up and running in 5 minutes. This guide will walk you through getting your API key, creating your first delivery, and seeing the result.

### 1. Get Your API Key

Before you can make any API calls, you need to get your API key.

You can find your API key in the **Settings > API Keys** section of your [Dora Dashboard](https://usedora.com/auth/login).

  This guide uses the **Development** environment:
  `https://dev.api.fleets.usedora.com/api/v1`

### 2. Make Your First Call (Create Delivery)

Now, let's use that key to create your first delivery. Open your terminal and paste in the following `curl` command, replacing `YOUR_API_KEY` with your **Development API Key**.

This command creates a simple delivery with the minimum required fields.

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --url [https://dev.api.fleets.usedora.com/api/v1/deliveries](https://dev.api.fleets.usedora.com/api/v1/deliveries) \
     --header 'x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data '{
        "pickup_address": "123 Main St, Lagos, Nigeria",
        "dropoff_address": "456 Market Rd, Lagos, Nigeria",
        "customer_name": "John Doe",
        "customer_phone": "+2348012345678"
     }'
