## How does it work?

After signing up, you will have a hosted platform for deploying new internal tools â€“ we call them tasks.
Each task on Dora is created with a Task configuration file written with one of Dora's SDKs.

```html
<button onclick="checkout()">Get Estimates</button>
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://cdn.api.usedora.com/v1/chain.js"></script>
<script type="application/javascript">
    function checkout() {
        const checkout = new Dora.GetEstimate({
            "sender_address": "10 John Street, Ipaja, Lagos",
            "customer_name": "TundeNasri",
            "customer_email": "sinoma@example.com",
            "customer_state_id": 4,
            "customer_house_number": 4,
            "customer_phone_number": "0802839***8",
            "phone_code": 234,
            "customer_address": "12 Ahmadu Bello way, Central Business District, Abuja",
            "delivery_total_order_value": 10000,
            "delivery_number_of_parcels": 1,
            "delivery_unit_weight": 10,
            "items": {
                [
                  "item_description": "Freshfish",
                  "item_quantity": 1,
                  "item_weight": 10,
                  "item_value": 10000
                ]
            },
            onSuccess(response) {
                console.log(response.event);
            },
            onError(error) {
                console.log(error);
            },
            onClose(event) {
                console.log("Widget closed", { event });
            },
        });
        checkout.setup();
        checkout.open();
    }    
</script>
```

We provide a library of predefined methods and integrations that you can use within your tasks, 
such as emitting logs or posting to Slack.
You can browse the full list of supported integrations [here](/nodesdk/integrations).
We are building more integrations so that you can compose truly end-to-end workflows.

The Task configuration file is all you need to create a production-ready task.
After a task is created and synced to Dora, you get an autogenerated UI,
real-time updates of your task run, and built-in auditing to keep track of previous task runs.
