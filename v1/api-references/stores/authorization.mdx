To ensure the security of your store's data and resources, every request made to your store's API should include an access token.

### Authorization header

Bearer authentication requires including an "Authorization" header in the HTTP request. The header should be in the following format:
```
Authorization: Bearer <store_access_token>
Content-Type: application/json
```
Here, `<store_access_token>` represents the unique access token generated when you created your store.

### Generating Your Store Access Token

To generate your store access token, follow these steps:

- Sign In: Log in to your [account](https://usedora.com/auth/login) on our platform using your credentials.

- Navigate to Integrations: Locate and click on the "Custom Stores/Website" tab. This is where you can manage various settings related to your store.

### Security Considerations

Keep your store's access token confidential. Do not share it publicly or expose it in client-side code. Use secure methods to store and transmit the token, such as environment variables or securely encrypted storage.
