## How does it work?

After signing up, you will have a hosted platform for deploying new internal tools â€“ we call them tasks.
Each task on Dora is created with a Task configuration file written with one of Dora's SDKs.  
We currently support:
- Node
- Express.

We're rolling out Python SDKs for Flask & Django soon.

```typescript
import { Task } from '@Dorahq/node'
import { slack } from '@Dorahq/integrations'
import organizationService from '../businessLogic/organizationService'

const task = new Task({
  name: "Create new organization",
  description: "Creates a new organization on the app",
  slug: 'create-org',
  input: {
    orgName: {
      type: "string",
      name: "Organization name",
    },
    size: {
      type: "number",
      name: "Size",
      required: false,
      description: "The number of seats in the organization",
    },
  },
  run: async (input, context) => {
    const { orgName, size } = input;
    // Define your custom logic here
    console.log('Do some stuff');
    const org = organizationService.createOrg(orgName);
    await slack.postMessage({
      message: 'Created org ${orgName}`,
      channel: '#customers'
    })
    context.logger.info('Successfully created new organization');
    return org;
  }
});
```

We provide a library of predefined methods and integrations that you can use within your tasks, 
such as emitting logs or posting to Slack.
You can browse the full list of supported integrations [here](/nodesdk/integrations).
We are building more integrations so that you can compose truly end-to-end workflows.

The Task configuration file is all you need to create a production-ready task.
After a task is created and synced to Dora, you get an autogenerated UI,
real-time updates of your task run, and built-in auditing to keep track of previous task runs.
